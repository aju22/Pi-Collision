# Pi-Collision
Estimating Digits of Pi using Physics Collisions.

# Idea
Inspired from famous 3blue1brown video, which talks about estimating pi using elastic collisions between two boxes.

Tried to implement in code, and added the satisfying clacks.


# Code
Written in python, using P5 library for graphic implementation.

# Looks Good !
